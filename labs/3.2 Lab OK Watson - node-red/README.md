# Introduction

This hands-on, technically-oriented lab demonstrates the key capabilities of IBM Cloud Platform, Node-RED and Watson services. Attendees will first learn how to play with Node-RED and Watson services such as Text to Speech, Speech to Text, Conversation and Tone Analyzer. Then they will learn how to integrate Watson services in a web application with an interface using Node.js. This lab will give attendees a jump-start on each of these APIs.
