Those who qualify for and apply an academic code to their IBM Cloud account will convert their account type from Lite to Trial.

> Trial account users are entitled to access the free service levels ($Free Plan) for each IBM Cloud service. Please note that accounts which are converted from Lite to Trial will be expired at the end of the trial/promotional period if a new code is not applied which extends the account. Trial accounts do not require credit card information.
