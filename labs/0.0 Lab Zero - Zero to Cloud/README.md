# Step 1 - Compute Options and Catalog Overview

IBM's innovative cloud computing platform combines platform as a service (PaaS) with infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and includes a catalog of cloud services that can be integrated with PaaS and IaaS to build business applications.

You can choose from bare metal servers to serverless compute to build the best solution for your workload

# Step 2 - Create your application using a starter kit

In IBM Cloud, you can build enterprise-level mobile and web applications and take advantage of cloud extensions that are hosted by IBM Cloud. You can use the IBM Cloud console and command line tools to build, run, and deploy your apps. Get started in two ways: create an app with a starter kit that manages the process for you, or if you know what you want, build your app with the resources you need.

You can use a starter kit to quickly get your app started and prepare it for future development. Choose a starter kit and programming language, create an app, and then set up a DevOps toolchain to automatically deploy your app. You can also download the code for immediate inspection.
